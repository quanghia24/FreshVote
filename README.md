## Requirements
A business owner can create a page that allows visitors to recommend new features to the business owner's app.

Visitors can view the pages that the business owner shares.
Visitors can upvote/downvote features that have been recommended.
The number of up/down votes should be limited per visitor + page.

The recommended features should allow for a title + description, and other visitors should be allowed to leave comments on each feature, as should business owners.

Business owners should be able to mark features with a status (closed, opened, considering, planned, in progress, etc.)
